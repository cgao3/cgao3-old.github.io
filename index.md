### Biography
I am a PhD student at the Department of Computing Science, co-supervised by [Prof. Martin Mueller](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~mmueller/) and [Prof. Ryan Hayward](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hayward/). 

I received my M.S. degree in 2015 from the [Department of Computer Science and Technology from University of Science and Technology of China](http://cs.ustc.edu.cn), where I worked at [USTC-Birmingam Joint Research Institute in Intelligent Computation and Its Applications](http://ubri.ustc.edu.cn/).


### Research 
I have a wide interest in various aspects of Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research.  

### [WHY the game of Hex](./WhyHex.md)

### Programming Skills

Note that in comparison to MoHex3HNN and DeepEzo, previous champion program MoHex 2.0 is now a weak baseline.
